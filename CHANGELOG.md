## Breaking Changes

None yet - this is the first stable release.

---

## Migration Guide

### From v1.0.0 to v1.1.0

No migration needed! The app automatically:
- Detects existing localStorage data
- Loads events on startup
- Preserves onboarding state

If you want to reset:
```javascript
// Clear all app data
localStorage.removeItem('connectsphere_onboarded');
localStorage.removeItem('connectsphere_events');
// Then refresh the page
```

---

## Technical Debt

### Known Issues
1. **Mock Data Dependencies**
   - Buddies/users are hardcoded
   - Location suggestions are static
   - Image uploads not functional

2. **Edit Functionality**
   - Edit buttons show toast but don't open forms
   - Need modal variants for editing

3. **Performance**
   - Large event lists may slow down
   - No pagination implemented
   - No virtual scrolling

4. **Accessibility**
   - Keyboard navigation needs improvement
   - Screen reader support incomplete
   - Focus management could be better

### Code Quality
- Some components exceed 500 lines (should refactor)
- Duplicate buddy data across modals (should centralize)
- Magic strings for localStorage keys (should use constants)
